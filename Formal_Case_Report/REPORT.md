## Recommendations

1. **Reset password** for user `charles.ngwenya` immediately.
2. **Block IP** `196.54.102.19` via firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
3. **Implement Fail2Ban** or similar SSH protection tool.
4. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** where possible.
5. **Audit all login activity** across the system for lateral movement.
6. **Educate users** about strong password policies.
